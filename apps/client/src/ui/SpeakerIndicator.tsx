/**
 * In-round speaker indicator (Story 3.4) — the richer cousin of the Story 2.5
 * lobby speaker dot. It renders one **pill** (avatar dot + name + pulse) per
 * currently-transmitting participant, top-left of the HUD, so anyone in the round
 * (including a listen-only spectator) can see who's talking.
 *
 * Rendering-only (project-context: components carry zero game/voice logic):
 * - The pill set is a pure reflection of `voiceStore.activeSpeakers`, which
 *   `connectVoice` already populates from LiveKit `ActiveSpeakersChanged` WITH the
 *   150ms stop-grace flicker suppression applied upstream (Story 2.5). We do NOT
 *   re-implement the grace here — we just map the ids to pills.
 * - Names come from `gameStore.session.players` (the durable-id roster); self is
 *   `gameStore.myPlayerId`. We READ gameStore for display only — never write it.
 *
 * Color (DESIGN.md color reservations): the self pill uses `speaker-self` (cool
 * blue, identity-only); every other active speaker uses `speaker-active` (LED
 * green). Name is ALWAYS shown beside the dot — never icon-only (accessibility
 * floor). The pulse is `motion-safe:`-gated exactly like the lobby dot so
 * reduced-motion users get a static active state (AC #5).
 *
 * Note (the muted self has no pill): `activeSpeakers` only holds ids that are
 * currently transmitting, so a muted self simply drops out — correct. AC #3's
 * "my indicator shows a muted state" is carried by `MuteControl`'s own glyph, not
 * by a persistent self pill.
 *
 * Placement: top-left only, kept clear of the top-center/right timer zone (the
 * timer LCD is Stories 4.4/4.5 — the pill must never collide with it).
