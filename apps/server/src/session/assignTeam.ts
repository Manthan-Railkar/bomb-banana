/**
 * Pure assignment: returns a new SessionState with the player moved onto a
 * team with the given role. No I/O, no clock, no randomness — same discipline
 * as createSessionState / addPlayerToSession.
 *
 * This function owns the `teams` record. `relayOrder` is kept equal to
 * assignment order because the GDD's default defuse rotation IS team join
 * order; Epic 8 stories own reordering and rotation mechanics. Rules:
 * - The target TeamState is created lazily on first assignment.
 * - A player joins the end of the target team's relayOrder (once).
 * - Moving teams removes the player from the old relayOrder; an emptied team
 *   is deleted, keeping `teams` matching its Partial semantics (a team exists
 *   iff someone is on it).
 * - A role-only change never moves the player's relayOrder position.
 * - `currentDefuserIndex` stays 0: the handler's lobby-phase guard means no
 *   round has ever run when team MOVES execute (TEAM_ASSIGN only moves teams in
 *   the lobby), so there is nothing to clamp here. Story 8.9 resolves the
 *   deferred "index not re-clamped on a cross-team move" item (deferred-work.md)
 *   at the READ side instead: `startRound` no longer wraps the index with a
 *   modulo — it reads it RAW with an `0 <= index < relayOrder.length` bounds
 *   check, so an out-of-range index cleanly yields "no natural pick" (exhausted)
 *   rather than wrapping to the wrong player. The Story 8.9 equalisation
 *   volunteer designation is a role-only change (no team move, no relayOrder
 *   mutation), so it likewise never desynchronises the index.
 *
 * Guard clauses (defensive — the handler errors first, but pure functions
 * never trust): an unknown playerId returns the state unchanged (same
 * reference). Idempotency: re-asserting the player's current teamId + role also
 * returns the same reference, so a duplicate emit is a structural no-op for the
 * handler (no persist, no broadcast).
 *
 * Story 9.5: a Facilitator who opts onto a team is assigned like ANY player —
 * there is no `role === 'facilitator'` refusal here anymore. Their play `role`
 * (defuser/expert/spectator) is set and they are appended to `relayOrder`;
 * session authority is unaffected because it lives in `state.facilitatorPlayerId`
 * (see `isSessionFacilitator`), not in the roster role. The `role` argument is
 * still handler-validated to never BE 'facilitator' (the seat is mint-only).
