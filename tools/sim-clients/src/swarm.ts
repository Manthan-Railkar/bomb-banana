/**
 * Swarm orchestration — spawn a cluster of BotClients and run rounds.
 *
 * Two modes, because TEAM_ASSIGN / PREPARATION_OPEN / ROUND_START are
 * facilitator-only (server authority):
 *
 *  - AUTONOMOUS (`buildAutonomousSwarm` + `playRound`): one bot is the
 *    Facilitator (mints itself via SESSION_CREATE), assigns teams, and drives the
 *    round lifecycle. Fully headless — used by the verify harness and any future
 *    automated E2E.
 *
 *  - HYBRID/JOIN (`buildJoinSwarm`): player bots join an existing session a HUMAN
 *    created; the human Facilitator (in a real browser) assigns teams and drives
 *    rounds, while the bots react to each BOMB_INIT. This is the workflow that
 *    unblocks the 8.6 / 8.1 human-verification gates without juggling browsers.
 *
 * The reactive Defuser loop lives in BotClient and serves BOTH modes — the only
 * difference is WHO performs the facilitator actions.
