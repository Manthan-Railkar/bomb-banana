 * The Defuser click primitive (Story 5.1, FR20 / UX-DR13).
 *
 * EXPERIENCE.md: "Click (Defuser): sole module interaction primitive. Wire
 * cut = click. Button press = mousedown+mouseup. Button hold = mousedown,
 * sustain, mouseup." Right/middle-click are reserved; there are NO bomb-side
 * keyboard shortcuts (prevents Defuser self-coaching).
 *
 * These helpers are the gesture vocabulary every DefuserView uses. They:
 * - accept only the primary button,
 * - reject drag-orbit releases (camera-controls owns left-drag),
 * - stop propagation so module-internal clicks don't re-trigger ModuleBay's
 *   click-to-focus on the faceplate behind them,
 * - emit module ACTIONS via callbacks — they know nothing about sockets or
 *   reducers. Hold duration is never measured here: "sustained" is reducer
 *   state between the press and release actions (no wall-clock game rules).
 *
 * Typed structurally (not against ThreeEvent) so the pure logic is testable
 * without an R3F canvas; R3F's ThreeEvent satisfies this shape.

 * gesture chokepoints below read this module-level flag, which the active
 * `BombScene` sets from its `readOnly` prop. A client renders exactly ONE
 * BombScene at a time — a Defuser's interactive bomb OR a spectator's lounge
 * bomb, never both — so a single flag is unambiguous. The helpers also accept an

 *
 * The release is delivered even after a drag (no drag-tolerance check on

 * correctness is judged by the reducer anyway. The pointer is captured on
 * press so a release outside the mesh still arrives. A pointercancel (gesture
 * stolen by the browser / context lost) is treated as a release for the same
 * reason — a captured hold must never strand the module in `held: true`.
 *

 * the module surface owns ALL its pointer events, so a reserved-button press
 * must not bubble to ModuleBay's click-to-focus either.
