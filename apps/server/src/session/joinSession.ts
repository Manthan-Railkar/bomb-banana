 * Pure join: returns a new SessionState with the player added to the roster.
 * No I/O, no clock, no randomness — same discipline as createSessionState.
 *
 * Idempotency guard: if the playerId is already in the roster, the state is
 * returned unchanged (same reference). This keeps a duplicate SESSION_JOIN a
 * no-op and — critically — means a facilitator re-joining their own session
 * can never demote their play role. (Story 9.5: facilitator AUTHORITY no longer
 * depends on the 'facilitator' role marker at all — it lives in the
 * `facilitatorPlayerId` flag — so even a role change here would not touch it;
 * this guard now protects only the roster row's current play role.)
 *
 * No teamId is assigned here — team assignment is Story 2.4's TEAM_ASSIGN.
