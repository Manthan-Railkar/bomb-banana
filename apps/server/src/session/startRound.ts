/**
 * Pure transition: preparation → active, committing the Defuser for the SINGLE
 * ACTIVE team (Story 8.11, Model B). No I/O, no clock, no randomness. (Story 8.3
 * FR11 for the natural pick; Story 8.9 FR43/FR44 for the terminal + odd-team
 * equalisation; Story 8.11 narrows arming from all-populated-teams to one.)
 *
 * The active team is `state.activeTeamId`, selected by `openPreparation` via the
 * shared `selectActiveTeam` snake rule. EXACTLY ONE team is armed; `round.defusers`
 * has ONE entry. The other team RESTS (absent from `round.defusers`, stale
 * 'defuser' demoted to 'expert'). Two per-active-team outcomes:
 *  1. NATURAL round — the active team has an un-played rotation slot
 *     (`0 <= currentDefuserIndex < relayOrder.length`, read RAW). Commit
 *     `relayOrder[currentDefuserIndex]`. The raw read caps the rotation: an
 *     exhausted index yields no natural pick (no wrap).
 *  2. EQUALISATION round — the active team has exhausted its natural rotation but
 *     still OWES an equalisation round. Commit the Facilitator-assigned
 *     `equalisationVolunteerId` (AC-4) — never a wrapped pick. Refuse
 *     (EQUALISATION_VOLUNTEER_REQUIRED) if none is designated: the server never
 *     auto-picks. The `equalisationRoundsPlayed` bump + the volunteer clear happen
 *     at RESOLVE (`resolveRound`), the single pointer-advance site (Story 8.11
 *     Task 2 decision) — `startRound` only READS the volunteer.
 *
 * Role commitment (one Defuser, settled in the story spec):
 * - The selected player becomes 'defuser' — even if currently 'spectator'.
 * - Any OTHER 'defuser' on EITHER team becomes 'expert' (incl. the whole resting
 *   team) so resting players are not stranded on a bomb surface.
 * - Off-team players (no `teamId`) are never touched — this includes the TEAMLESS
 *   facilitator. Story 9.5: a facilitator who has OPTED ONTO a team DOES have a
 *   `teamId`, so this pass reconciles their play `role` like any player (their
 *   'facilitator' role marker is intentionally overwritten). Their session
 *   authority is UNAFFECTED because it lives in `state.facilitatorPlayerId`, not
 *   in `role` (see `isSessionFacilitator`).
 *
 * RETRY round (Story 8.8, FR14) — takes priority when `state.retryingTeamId` is
 * set. ONLY the retrying team is armed with the EXACT Defuser that played the
 * failed round (`state.retryDefuserId`, carried from `RoundState.defusers` by the
 * handler — NOT recomputed from the pointer, which under Model B has already
 * advanced past that player); the other team rests; `retry: true` drives the
 * resolveRound better-of-two. The retry markers are cleared in the returned state;
 * `currentDefuserIndex`, `equalisationRoundsPlayed`, `activeTeamId`, and every
 * pointer are UNTOUCHED (`retryRound` set `activeTeamId = retryingTeamId` for
 * client routing).
 *
 * Integrity guard: if the active team's selected player is missing from `players`
 * the start is refused (NO_POPULATED_TEAM); an absent/undesignated active team is
 * the same refusal (`openPreparation` always sets a valid `activeTeamId` for a
 * not-complete relay, and `hasPopulatedTeam` gates the open).
 */

 * Whether the NEXT active team has a defuser-able player THIS round — its natural

 * condition for the team `selectActiveTeam` will pick, so it is the right
 * precondition for opening Preparation: if true a subsequent ROUND_START cannot
 * fail with NO_POPULATED_TEAM. Pure. Returns false when the relay is complete
