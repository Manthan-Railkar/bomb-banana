/**
 * simon-says — a Hard-tier module (Story 7.2, GDD Module 4).
 *
 * Four coloured buttons flash a growing sequence; the Defuser translates each
 * flash through the correct table and presses the mapped colour. The table is
 * chosen by whether the serial number contains a vowel (Table A) or not
 * (Table B) AND by the CURRENT team strike count (0/1/2) — so the mapping
 * shifts mid-round as strikes accrue. Enter the whole revealed sequence
 * correctly and it grows by one; complete the final stage to disarm.
 *
 * Pure logic lives HERE in packages/shared so both the server registry
 * (MODULE_REDUCERS, runtime via tsx) and the client sandbox run the SAME code;
 * apps/client/src/modules/simon-says/ re-exports it.
 *
 * LIVE STRIKE COUNT (the design crux): the module reducer only receives its own
 * ModuleState, never BombState, so it cannot read `bomb.strikes` directly. The
 * live strike count therefore enters as an ACTION INPUT (the-button's proven
 * RELEASE.timerDigits pattern) — and the MODULE_INTERACT handler stamps the
 * AUTHORITATIVE `bomb.strikes` onto the action before reducing, overriding any
 * client-sent value (server-authoritative; a spoofed 0 would be a cheat). The
 * serial-vowel half is static and read from the public ctx carried in state.
