  [KEYPADS_MODULE_ID]: keypadsReducer as ModuleReducer,

  // colour-occurrence rules; auto-solves when all should-cut wires are severed
  // (first genuinely stateful Medium module — CUT + NAV).
  [WIRE_SEQUENCES_MODULE_ID]: wireSequencesReducer as ModuleReducer,
  // mazes: Story 6.4 — navigate a white light through an invisible-walled 6×6

  [MAZES_MODULE_ID]: mazesReducer as ModuleReducer,
