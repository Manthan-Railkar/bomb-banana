 *
 * This module never reads `process.env`, never touches Redis or Socket.IO —
 * the caller (voiceHandlers) injects credentials and supplies a participant
 * already resolved from authoritative session state. The role→room→grant
 * mapping below is the single place the voice topology rule lives (AR12).
