/**
 * Per-round state, stored at `session:{sessionId}:round:{n}` (architecture
 * Redis keyspace). Created by ROUND_START (Story 8.3).
 *
 * - `status` is `'active'` while the round runs; round resolution (Story 8.5)
 *   transitions it to a `RoundOutcome` once any team resolves. NOTE: a single
 *   `RoundState` is shared by both racing teams, so this round-level field is
 *   last-writer-wins across teams — it is NOT the per-team idempotency fence
 *   (that is each team's live timer key; see `resolveRound`). The authoritative
 *   per-team result is conveyed by `outcomes` (below) + which event fired
 *   (BOMB_DEFUSED vs BOMB_EXPLODED) + that team's `cumulativeTimeMs`, matching
 *   the `ScoreboardPayload` contract.
 * - `outcomes` records the per-team terminal result (Story 8.8). Set by
 *   `resolveRound` as each team resolves; the authoritative per-team outcome the
 *   round-level last-writer-wins `status` cannot express. The `ROUND_RETRY`
 *   handler reads it to gate retry to FAILED rounds only (a team is retryable iff
 *   `outcomes[teamId]` is `'exploded'`/`'time-expired'`). `Partial` because a
 *   team is present iff it resolved. (This widens the prior "future per-team
 *   round-outcome model" note.)
 * - `defusers` records the committed Defuser per team for this round —
 *   `Partial` because a team exists iff someone is on it (mirrors
 *   `SessionState.teams`). Values are roster keys (`PlayerInfo.playerId`).
 * - `retry` is `false` on a first attempt and `true` on a re-attempt round
 *   (Story 8.8). `resolveRound` reads it to record the BETTER of the two times
 *   in place (replace `roundTimesMs[roundNumber-1]`) instead of appending a
 *   second entry for the same round.
 * - `chapterAssignments` records the per-Expert manual-chapter allocation for a
 *   round restricted by the `asymmetricExpertRoles` modifier (Story 9.1): a map
 *   of playerId → assigned chapter ids, present ONLY for restricted Experts and
 *   absent/`undefined` when the round does not restrict (modifier off, or the
 *   active team has <2 Experts). SERVER-SIDE ONLY — it is NEVER part of any
 *   client broadcast (the reconnect re-send reads it and emits each Expert only
 *   their own slice; the initial delivery is a targeted per-socket emit). Roles
 *   themselves live on `SessionState.players`; the per-round chapter split
 *   belongs here.
