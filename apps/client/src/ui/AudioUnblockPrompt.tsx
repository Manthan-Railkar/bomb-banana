/**
 * Blocked-autoplay recovery affordance (Story 3.6, AC #6). A browser can reject
 * `room.startAudio()` without a user gesture, so a participant is genuinely
 * `connected` (transport up, tracks subscribed) yet hears nothing. `connectVoice`
 * surfaces that as `voiceStore.audioBlocked`; this prompt offers a click-to-resume
 * control while it's set, and a successful `resumeVoiceAudio()` clears the flag.
 *
 * Rendering-only (project-context: components carry zero game logic): the resume
 * logic lives in `voice/connectVoice.ts`. Purely additive playback recovery — the
 * participant stays `connected` and the game is unaffected (never blocks the UI).
 *
 * Self-gates: renders ONLY when `connected && audioBlocked`, so mounting it
 * unconditionally in the HUD (any in-round role) is safe.
 *
 * Placement: centered but lifted a row above the bottom controls (`bottom-20`),
 * so it never overlaps the mute control (bottom-left) or the connect/reconnect CTA
 * (bottom-right) even on a narrow viewport, and stays clear of the top-left pills
 * and the top-center/right timer zone (Stories 4.4/4.5).
