/**
 * Server-time offset estimation (Story 4.4, architecture Pattern 5 / ADR-005:
 * "estimated once at connect, refreshed on each timer broadcast").
 *
 * Every running-segment TIMER_UPDATE carries a server timestamp stamped at
 * emit (`startedAt` — segments are always rebased on change), so
 * `startedAt − receivedAt` estimates `serverEpoch − clientEpoch` with an error
 * of one-way latency. The error biases the displayed clock BEHIND the server —
 * the safe direction: the client never shows expiry before the server declares
 * it (AC3). Paused broadcasts are skipped (`startedAt` is not fresh there).
 *
 * Single-sample estimator by design — smoothing / RTT compensation is Story
 * 8.4's call when the real server emitter lands.
