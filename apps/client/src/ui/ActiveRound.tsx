/**
 * Active-round surface routing (Story 8.3, FR11) — the same session URL shows
 * a different primary surface per committed role (EXPERIENCE.md role-gating
 * principle; roles never see each other's surface).
 *
 * ACTIVE-TEAM ROUTING (Story 8.11, Model B): exactly one team plays per round.
 * We route by ACTIVE TEAM FIRST, role second — a player whose team is NOT
 * `session.activeTeamId` is RESTING and sees a spectate/standby surface for ALL
 * roles (never a dead bomb or a manual for a bomb nobody on their team is
 * solving). The full split-pane lounge is Story 9.4; this is the legible interim.
 *
 * - Active-team Defuser: the bomb. BombScene tolerates `bomb === null` (falls back
 *   to its dev placeholder modules) until BOMB_INIT.
 * - Active-team Expert: the manual (5.2) — same chapter wiring as Preparation.
 * - Resting team (any role) / Spectator / Facilitator: standby panels; the
 *   Spectator Lounge is Epic 9 and the in-round facilitator dashboard is 8.5+.
 * No HUD work here — the timer LCD and strike indicator are Stories 4.4/4.5.
