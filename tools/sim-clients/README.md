# sim-clients — headless bot-swarm simulator

A **dev-only** tool: real socket clients that fill player seats and self-solve
rounds, so a solo dev can verify the multiplayer game loop (Stories **8.6**
between-round flow / scoreboard and **8.1** difficulty dashboard) **without
juggling four-plus browser windows**.

The bots are ordinary `socket.io-client` connections typed against the real
`ClientToServerEvents` / `ServerToClientEvents` contract — indistinguishable from
a browser to the server. They compute each move from the **public** `BOMB_INIT`
snapshot using the shared pure solve functions (`solveWires`, `decideButton` +
`releaseDigitFor`, `isValidPassword`) — the same honest path a human Defuser
reading the manual takes. No baked answer is read (there isn't one to read).

## The control panel (the easy way) 🕹️

A single browser page that runs the **whole swarm in-browser** and gives you one
dashboard for every bot — no terminal flags, no four windows. Same `BotClient`
as the CLI (socket.io-client + the framework-free shared solvers are browser-safe;
the server's CORS is `origin: true`).

```
pnpm --filter @bomb-squad/sim-clients panel     # opens http://localhost:5180
```

**Spawn**: pick **Join** (you host the session as Facilitator in a real browser,
paste its code) or **Create** (a bot is Facilitator and you drive everything from
the panel). Set teams / per-team / sizes and a default auto-mode.

**Per-bot controls + live status**

| Control | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| Status row | connection, **team + role**, ready, strikes (n/3), result; 🎯 marks the current Defuser |
| Ready / Unready | toggle a bot's ready — **works while the session is paused** (satisfy a disconnect-resume gate) |
| Disconnect / Reconnect | drop a bot's socket, then **reattach the same seat** (Story 2.7 token) — mid-round this trips the disconnect-pause |
| Solve | the active Defuser self-solves the whole bomb on demand |
| Detonate | the active Defuser strikes until it explodes (3 strikes) |
| +1 strike | emit a single wrong action (one strike) |
| auto-mode ▾ | per-bot `manual` / `defuse` / `strike` / `timeout` on each `BOMB_INIT` |

**Bomb details** (shown for the active round): serial, batteries, indicators,
ports, live strikes, solved count, the seed-derivation line, and a per-module
table (id · status · a compact data summary — wire colours/cuts, button
colour+label, password letters).

**Bulk + Facilitator** (Create mode): Open Prep · Cancel Prep · Start Round ·
Pause · Resume, plus All Ready, Ready (resume-gate), Solve all, Detonate active,
Reconnect all, Teardown. A live event log streams every bot's server events.

> Same server caveat as below: run the game server on plain `tsx`, **not**
> `tsx watch` (a watch restart drops the in-memory timer wake).

## The hybrid workflow (the common case)

**You stay the Facilitator in one real browser** — that's exactly the UI 8.6 /
8.1 ask you to verify. The bots are the players.

```
1. Browser: host a session as Facilitator  →  note the join code (e.g. ABC123)
2. Terminal: pnpm --filter @bomb-squad/sim-clients sim --code ABC123 --teams 2 --per-team 2
3. Browser: assign the bots to teams, open Preparation, Start the round.
            → the Defuser bots self-solve; watch the scoreboard / between-round flow.
   Next round: just open Preparation + Start again — the bots follow the rotated Defuser.
```

> **Run the server on plain `tsx`, NOT `tsx watch`.** A watch restart drops the
> in-memory `setTimeout` timer wake (single-process V1), which breaks the
> `--outcome timeout` path. (See `timer-verification-tsx-watch-gotcha`.)

## Fully headless (no human)

A bot can also be the Facilitator and drive everything itself — useful for a
quick smoke or future automation:

```
pnpm --filter @bomb-squad/sim-clients sim --create --teams 2 --per-team 2 --rounds 2
```

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--url <url>` | `http://localhost:8080` | Server URL (use your Docker stack origin) |
| `--code <joinCode>` | — | Join an existing human-created session (hybrid mode) |
| `--create` | off | Spawn a bot Facilitator that creates + drives the session |
| `--teams <n>` | `2` | Number of teams (1 or 2) |
| `--per-team <n>` | `2` | Players per team (uniform) |
| `--sizes <a,b>` | — | Asymmetric team sizes, e.g. `3,2` (3 on A, 2 on B). Overrides `--teams`/`--per-team`. |
| `--outcome <o>` | `defuse` | `defuse` \| `strike` \| `timeout` |
| `--rounds <n>` | `1` | (`--create` only) rounds to play |

> **Min team size is 2.** The game is the Defuser↔Expert split (the Defuser sees
> the bomb but not the manual; an Expert reads the manual). A team of 1 can't
> play, so the server refuses to start a round with one — the smallest valid
> *odd* case is `--sizes 3,2`. A single-team session is fine if that team has ≥2
> (e.g. `--sizes 2` or `--teams 1 --per-team 2`).

`--outcome`:
- **defuse** — the Defuser bot solves every module (cuts the right wire, taps/holds
  the button releasing on the right timer digit, cycles passwords to the unique word).
- **strike** — emits one deliberately-wrong action on the first strikeable module.
- **timeout** — idles and lets the server clock run the round out.

## Verify (Docker-free end-to-end)

```
pnpm --filter @bomb-squad/sim-clients verify
```

Boots an **in-process** Socket.IO server wired with the real session + module
handlers over an in-memory Redis, then runs the autonomous swarm to prove the
bots drive the real reducers: a two-team **defuse** (wires + passwords), a
**multi-round** run (Defuser rotation), a **button** defuse (PRESS/RELEASE +
timer-digit hold loop over sockets), and a **strike**. Exits non-zero on failure.

## Honest boundaries

- **No LiveKit voice and no 3D rendering** — those need real browsers and are out
  of scope (Epic 3 / the bomb scene). 8.6 and 8.1 don't depend on voice.
- The bots hold no game logic beyond *choosing* a move; they mirror server state
  and let the server adjudicate (server-authoritative). Only the current Defuser
  interacts — a non-Defuser's emit just earns a typed `ERROR`, which is logged.
- Team assignment is **sequential** by design: `TEAM_ASSIGN` is a load-modify-store
  on the single session key, and the server's accepted concurrency model is
  human-speed; firing assignments concurrently would race the read-modify-write.

## Layout

```
src/
  main.ts        CLI (hybrid --code / autonomous --create)
  swarm.ts       orchestration: build swarm, assign teams, play rounds
  BotClient.ts   one simulated player (typed socket + state mirror + solve loop +
                 on-demand solveNow/detonateNow/reconnect for the panel)
  solvers.ts     module → shared-solve dispatch (+ wrong-action variants)
  timerDigits.ts timer-LCD digit extraction (mirror of apps/client timerLcd.ts)
  verify.ts      Docker-free in-process end-to-end check
panel/
  index.html     control-panel shell + styles
  main.ts        the dashboard: spawn a swarm, render live status, drive each bot
vite.config.ts   dev server for the panel (root: panel/, port 5180)
```

> The panel runs bots in the browser, so it must never import `verify.ts` (it
> pulls in `@bomb-squad/server` + `socket.io`, which are Node-only).

The shipped tool depends only on `@bomb-squad/shared` + `socket.io-client`.
`@bomb-squad/server` + `socket.io` are **dev** dependencies used only by
`verify.ts` to boot the in-process server; nothing in the app/server/shared
packages imports this tool.
