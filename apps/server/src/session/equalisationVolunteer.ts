/**
 * Pure transition (Story 8.9 AC-2, FR44): designate the Facilitator's volunteer
 * Defuser for a team's NEXT equalisation round. No I/O, no clock, no randomness.
 *
 * This is the documented EXCEPTION to "rotation is the sole Defuser authority"
 * (Story 8.6 decision (c)): an odd-team equalisation round repeats an
 * already-defused player, and that player is the Facilitator's explicit choice —
 * the server never auto-picks. It is reached by REUSING the existing `TEAM_ASSIGN`
 * event (no new socket event — Story 8.9 Task 1): when the session is between
 * rounds / in preparation and the named team owes an equalisation round, a
 * `TEAM_ASSIGN` for an on-team player routes here instead of `assignPlayerToTeam`.
 *
 * Deliberately NARROW (the deferred-work.md between-rounds-assignment can of
 * worms): this is a ROLE-ONLY designation — it never moves teams, never mutates
 * `relayOrder`, never touches `currentDefuserIndex`. So it cannot desynchronise
 * the rotation pointer the way a between-rounds team move could.
 *
 * Effects (immutable — spread, never mutate in place):
 * - records `team.equalisationVolunteerId = playerId` (consumed + cleared by
 *   `startRound` when the equalisation round commits);
 * - sets the chosen player's role to 'defuser' and demotes any OTHER 'defuser' on
 *   that team to 'expert' (the single-Defuser discipline `startRound` also keeps),
 *   so the prep surface shows the volunteer as the upcoming Defuser.
 *
 * Guards (defensive — the handler validates first, but pure functions never
 * trust): the team must currently OWE an equalisation round (else there is no
 * equalisation round to staff — `NO_EQUALISATION_OWED`); the player must already
 * be on that team's `relayOrder`, i.e. have defused before (`NOT_ON_TEAM`).
 * Re-asserting the same volunteer returns the same reference (idempotent no-op).
