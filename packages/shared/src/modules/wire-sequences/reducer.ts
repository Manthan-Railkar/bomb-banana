/**
 * Pure reducer for the Wire Sequences module — the first genuinely STATEFUL
 * module (multi-panel + NAV + cumulative-occurrence auto-solve).
 *
 * Contract obligations (project-context Testing Rules):
 *  - Actions arrive as `unknown` (untrusted client input) — guard, never throw.
 *  - Never mutate input state; return new objects via spread/map.
 *  - 'struck' is TRANSIENT: returned to signal a wrong cut; the bomb reducer
 *    rolls it into a team strike and re-arms. The wrongly-cut wire STAYS
 *    severed (cuts are physical) — that is what makes a repeat CUT a no-op and
 *    satisfies the idempotency AC.
 *  - Cutting an already-severed wire is a no-op (idempotent — never a second
 *    strike for the same wire).
 *  - NAV is purely a view change; it never strikes, never solves, and never
 *    affects occurrence counting (which is global and view-independent).
 *  - MODULE_RESET (forwarded whole by the bomb reducer, bypassing its
 *    solved-inert guard) re-arms: all wires uncut, currentPanel back to 0.
 *  - No Date.now(), no Math.random(), no I/O.
 *
 * CUT is intentionally POSITION-AGNOSTIC: it takes a GLOBAL wire index and is
 * NOT gated on currentPanel. The KTANE-faithful "only cut the visible panel"
 * rule is a UI concern (the client only makes current-panel wires clickable);
 * an out-of-panel index can only arrive from a malformed client and is handled
 * purely by the bounds guard.
