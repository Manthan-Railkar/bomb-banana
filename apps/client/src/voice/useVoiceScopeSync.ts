/**
 * Re-mint the voice connection when the local player's effective voice scope
 * changes mid-session (Story 3.5). Drives the pure {@link computeVoiceAction}
 * decision from the live `voiceStore` connection + the desired scope derived
 * from authoritative `SessionState`, and reconnects with a FRESH token (via
 * `reconnectVoice`, which `disconnect()`s then `connect()`s — `connectVoice`
 * never caches a token, so "old token never reused" holds) only when the
 * effective `{ room, publish }` actually changed.
 *
 * Reconnect-WITHOUT-gesture is intentional and correct here: the mic permission
 * + audio autoplay were already unlocked by the initial gesture-driven connect
 * for this page session, so re-establishing within the same session needs no new
 * gesture. Do NOT "fix" this back to a gesture gate — that would strand a
 * reassigned player in the wrong room. (The FIRST connect still requires the
 * `VoiceController` button; this only fires once `status === 'connected'`.)
 *
 * Reconnect-storm safety: `connectVoice`'s `connectEpoch` guard supersedes any
 * in-flight connect/disconnect, and `computeVoiceAction` compares against the
 * DESIRED scope (not each intermediate state), so a burst of `SESSION_STATE`
 * updates collapses to the latest target. Re-minting from `unavailable` (AC #5)
 * has no connected tuple to compare against, so a `lastAttemptRef` gate makes it
 * single-shot per target: a re-mint that itself fails settles back to
 * `unavailable` and would otherwise re-run this effect forever — the gate skips
 * a repeat toward the SAME desired scope (a genuinely new scope still fires).
