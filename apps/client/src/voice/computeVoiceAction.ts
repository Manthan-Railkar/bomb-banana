 * connection while the UI merely relabels — the bug this story fixes).
 *
 * Kept pure (no store/hook/LiveKit imports beyond the shared scope helper) so the

 * isn't known yet, so we cannot compare — the in-flight connect lands first, then
 * the next `connected` evaluation reconciles to the latest desired scope
 * (collapsing rapid SESSION_STATE bursts to the newest target, not each one).
 *
 * - **`desired === null`** (a role this client's voice UI does not manage —
 *   an un-teamed Bomb-Room role outside the lobby / self removed from the roster):
 *   TEAR DOWN. Leaving a connected — possibly still-publishing — connection alive
 *   in a room the player no longer belongs to is exactly the stale-scope leak this
 *   story targets (Story 3.5 review, finding 1). The relay's active↔resting
 *   routing (3.7) and roster removal can reach it. (Story 9.5: the facilitator is
 *   NO LONGER null — they resolve to the lounge/lobby like any lounge member.)
 * - **`connected` with a resolvable desired scope**: re-mint (disconnect → fresh
 *   connect) only when the desired `{ room, publish }` actually DIFFERS from the
 *   connected one. Comparing the full tuple is what makes Defuser↔Expert on the
 *   same team a no-op (identical room + publish ⇒ no audio drop — AC #3) while
 *   Spectator↔Facilitator in the shared lounge (same room, different publish)
 *   still re-mints.
 * - **`unavailable` with a resolvable desired scope** (a post-connect failure —
 *   transport drop or a failed connect the user already gestured for): re-mint
 *   toward the desired scope (AC #5, Story 3.5 review finding 2), so a player
 *   reassigned WHILE unavailable is not stranded showing the old room's
 *   affordance. `unavailable` clears `room`/`publishing`, so a tuple compare
 *   cannot gate this — the caller (`useVoiceScopeSync`) holds a single-shot
 *   attempt guard so a re-mint that keeps failing does not storm.
